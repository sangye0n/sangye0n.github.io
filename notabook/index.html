          <div class="mainhk"><h1>2019–20 Hong Kong protests</h1>
          <a><br>Hong Kong's protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to mainland China.
Critics feared this could undermine judicial independence and endanger dissidents.
Until 1997, Hong Kong was ruled by Britain as a colony but then returned to China. Under the "one country, two systems" arrangement, it has some autonomy, and its people more rights.
The bill was withdrawn in September but demonstrations continue and now demand full democracy and an inquiry into police actions.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs.<br></a>

          <h2>Christmas in Hong Kong marked by demonstrations and tear gas</h2>
          <d>26 Dec, 2019</d>

          <a><br>Anti-government protesters returned to the streets of Hong Kong over the Christmas holiday, clashing with riot police in malls and busy shopping districts across the semiautonomous Chinese territory. <br>

The city's embattled leader, Carrie Lam, accused the demonstrators of ruining the holiday. Her critics say the government and police used unnecessarily heavy-handed tactics to disperse what began as peaceful gatherings, albeit without official permission.<br><br>
Hundreds of black-clad protesters, many wearing reindeer antlers, occupied malls and other shopping areas on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day as part of the months-long campaign for democratic and police reforms in the city.<br><br>
Police accused the protesters of "rioting" and vandalism, and attempted to disperse them using pepper spray and batons while indoors, and firing tear gas and deploying water cannons on the streets.<br><br></a>

Protesters blocked roads and destroyed a bank branch. Police also said petrol bombs were thrown. More than 100 people were arrested, authorities said.<br><br>
Unlike in mainland China, December 25 and December 26 are public holidays in Hong Kong, where around 12% of the population are Christian.<br><br>
"Many members of the public and tourists coming to Hong Kong were naturally disappointed that their Christmas Eve celebrations have been ruined by a group of reckless and selfish rioters," Lam said in a Facebook post on Christmas Day.<br><br>

One protester was hospitalized after falling several feet in a mall on Christmas Eve. Authorities said he "pushed their officer to the ground and suddenly jumped across a glass fence in an attempt to escape, and fell."<br><br>
The man was conscious and sent to the hospital, and has since been arrested for assaulting a police officer.<br><br></a>

Hong Kong Watch, a UK-based non- governmental organization, accused the force of committing "truly outrageous police brutality" on Christmas Eve. The government responded to the allegations in a statement, saying that police only deployed "minimum force. "<br><br>
Scenes like these and accusations of wrongdoing on both sides have become increasingly common as the political unrest in the city has dragged on.<br><br></a>

The movement began in June, with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets to oppose a bill that would have allowed Hong Kong to extradite suspected criminals to mainland China.<br><br>
Though the bill was inspired by the city's inability to extradite the suspect of a grisly murder to Taiwan, many Hong Kongers feared it would be used by Beijing to pursue political dissidents in the city, which allows for greater freedom of speech and the press than on the mainland.<br><br>
China's legal system has a notoriously high conviction rate and is widely considered to be beholden to the ruling Communist Party.<br><br>
Lam agreed to withdraw the bill in September but failed to stymie the anger it inspired. The movement has since grown to encompass demands for universal suffrage and investigations into allegations of brutality against the city's police force -- once widely respected, but now marred by mistrust, according to opinion polls.<br><br>
Protests have become increasingly violent. In recent months, authorities have announced several seizures of homemade bombs and explosives.<br><br>
Authorities said they raided a storage warehouse on Wednesday in the industrial neighborhood of Kwun Tong after receiving an intelligence tip. In a Facebook post, police said they found 500 grams (17.6 ounces) of smoke bombs, 15 grams (0.5 ounces) of explosives, and dozens of bottles of chemicals.<br><br>
An 18-year-old student has been arrested and charged in relation to the seizures and could face 14 years in prison if convicted.</a>

<div class="mainsk"><h1>2016–2017 South Korean protests</h1>
          <a><br>2016–2017 South Korean protests, also known as Candlelight Struggle or Candlelight Revolution, were a series of protests against President Park Geun-hye that occurred throughout South Korea from November 2016 to March 2017.<br></a>

          <h2>South Korea Removes President Park Geun-hye</h2>
          <d>9 Mar, 2017<br>
          Choe Sang-Hun</d>
          <iframe title="New York Times Video - Embed Player" width=500px height=321px frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" id="nyt_video_player" src="https://www.nytimes.com/video/players/offsite/index.html?videoId=100000004982314"></iframe>
          <e><br>Supporters and opponents of President Park Geun-hye of South Korea took to the streets on Friday after the court issued a ruling to remove her from office, capping months of turmoil.</e>
          <a>SEOUL, South Korea — A South Korean court removed the president on Friday, a first in the nation’s history, rattling the delicate balance of relationships across Asia at a particularly tense time.<br><br>

Her removal capped months of turmoil, as hundreds of thousands of South Koreans took to the streets, week after week, to protest a sprawling corruption scandal that shook the top echelons of business and government.<br><br>

Park Geun-hye, the nation’s first female president and the daughter of the Cold War military dictator Park Chung-hee, had been an icon of the conservative establishment that joined Washington in pressing for a hard line against North Korea’s nuclear provocations.<br><br>

Now, her downfall is expected to shift South Korean politics to the opposition, whose leaders want more engagement with North Korea and are wary of a major confrontation in the region. They say they will re-examine the country’s joint strategy on North Korea with the United States and defuse tensions with China, which has sounded alarms about the growing American military footprint in Asia.<br><br>
Ms. Park’s powers were suspended in December after a legislative impeachment vote, though she continued to live in the presidential Blue House, largely alone and hidden from public view, while awaiting the decision by the Constitutional Court. The house had been her childhood home: She first moved in at the age of 9 and left it nearly two decades later after her mother and father were assassinated in separate episodes.<br><br>

Eight justices of the Constitutional Court unanimously decided to unseat Ms. Park for committing “acts that violated the Constitution and laws” throughout her time in office, Acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said in a ruling that was nationally broadcast.<br><br></a>
<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/11/world/10impeachyes-02/10impeachyes-02-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp" width=100% >
<a>
<e>Ms. Park’s acts “betrayed the trust of the people and were of the kind that cannot be tolerated for the sake of protecting the Constitution,” Justice Lee said.</e>
<a>
As the verdict was announced, silence fell over thousands of Park supporters who rallied near the courthouse waving South Korean flags. Soon, they tried to march on the court and called for “destroying” it. When the police blocked them, some of the mostly elderly protesters attacked the officers with flagpoles, hurling water bottles and pieces of the sidewalk pavement. Two pro-Park demonstrators, ages 60 and 72, died during the unrest.
Ms. Park did not comment on the ruling, and remained in the presidential palace after her removal from power. But In Myung-jin, the leader of Ms. Park’s conservative Liberty Korea Party, said he “humbly respected” the ruling.
<br><br>
With the immunity conferred by her office now gone, Ms. Park, 65, faces prosecutors seeking to charge her with bribery, extortion and abuse of power in connection with allegations of conspiring with a confidante, her childhood friend Choi Soon-sil, to collect tens of millions of dollars in bribes from companies like Samsung.
<br><br>
By law, the country must elect a new president within 60 days. The acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, an ally of Ms. Park’s, will remain in office in the interim. The Trump administration is rushing a missile defense system to South Korea so that it can be in place before the election.
<br><br>
After the ruling, Mr. Hwang called key Cabinet ministers to put the nation on a heightened state of military readiness, saying the lack of a president represented a national “emergency.” He also warned North Korea against making “additional provocations.”<br><br></a>
<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/11/world/10impeachyes-04/10impeachyes-04-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp" width=100% >
<a>
<e>Celebrating after the verdict by the Constitutional Court in Seoul, the capital, on Friday. By law, the country must elect a new president within 60 days.</e>



The last time a South Korean leader was removed from office under popular pressure was in 1960, when the police fired on crowds calling for President Syngman Rhee to step down. (Mr. Rhee, a dictator, fled into exile in Hawaii and died there.)
<br><br>
In a sign of how far South Korea’s young democracy has evolved, Ms. Park was removed without any violence, after large, peaceful protests in recent months demanding that she step down. In addition to the swell of popular anger, the legislature and the judiciary — two institutions that have been weaker than the presidency historically — were crucial to the outcome.
“This is a miracle, a new milestone in the strengthening and institutionalizing of democracy in South Korea,” said Kang Won-taek, a political scientist at Seoul National University.
<br><br>
When crowds took to the streets, they were not just seeking to remove a leader who had one year left in office. They were also rebelling against a political order that had held South Korea together for decades but is now fracturing under pressures both at home and abroad, analysts said.
<br><br>
Ms. Park’s father ruled South Korea from 1961 to 1979. He founded its economic growth model, which transformed the nation into an export powerhouse and allowed the emergence of family-controlled conglomerates known as chaebol that benefited from tax cuts and anti-labor policies.
<br><br>
Ms. Park was elected in 2012 with the support of older conservative South Koreans who revered her father for the country’s breakneck economic growth.<br><br></a>
<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/11/world/10impeachyes-05/10impeachyes-05-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp" width=100% >
<a>
<e>Supporters of Ms. Park trying to pass the barricade of police buses to protest the ruling. As the verdict was announced, silence fell over the supporters who rallied near the courthouse.<br></e><a>


But the nexus of industry and political power gave rise to collusive ties, highlighted by the scandal that led to Ms. Park’s fall.
<br><br>
The scandal also swept up the de facto head of Samsung, Lee Jae-yong, who was indicted on charges of bribing Ms. Park and her confidante, Ms. Choi.
Samsung, the nation’s largest conglomerate, has been tainted by corruption before. But the company has been considered too important to the economy for any of its top leaders to spend time behind bars — until now. The jailing of Mr. Lee, who is facing trial, is another potent sign that the old order is not holding.
<br><br>
In the wake of the Park scandal, all political parties have vowed to curtail presidential power to pardon chaebol tycoons convicted of white-collar crimes. They also promised to stop chaebol chairmen from helping their children amass fortunes through dubious means, like forcing their companies to do exclusive business with the children’s businesses.
<br><br>
With the conservatives discredited — and no leading conservative candidate to succeed Ms. Park — the left could take power for the first time in a decade. The dominant campaign issues will probably be North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and South Korea’s relations with the United States and China.
<br><br>
If the opposition takes power, it may try to revive its old “sunshine policy” of building ties with North Korea through aid and exchanges, an approach favored by China. That would complicate Washington’s efforts to isolate the North at a time other Asian nations like the Philippines are gravitating toward Beijing.<br><br></a>
<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/11/world/10impeachyes-07/10impeachyes-07-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp" width=100% >
<a>
<e>Supporters of Ms. Park scuffling with the police. Some officers were attacked with flagpoles, water bottles and pieces of the sidewalk pavement.</e>
<a>Moon Jae-in, the Democratic Party leader who is leading in opinion surveys, has said that a decade of applying sanctions on North Korea had failed to stop its nuclear weapons programs. He has said that sanctions are necessary, but that “their goal should be to draw North Korea back to the negotiating table.”
<br><br>
He believes that Ms. Park’s decision to allow the deployment of the American missile defense system — known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad — has dragged the country into the dangerous and growing rivalry between Washington and Beijing; China has called the system a threat to its security and taken steps to punish South Korea economically for accepting it.
Conservative South Koreans see the deployment of the antimissile system not only as a guard against the North but also as a symbolic reaffirmation of the all-important alliance with the United States. Mr. Moon’s party demands that the deployment, which began this week, be suspended immediately. If it takes power, it says it will review the deployment of the antimissile system to determine if it is in South Korea’s best interest.
<br><br>
As South Korea has learned, it cannot always keep Washington and Beijing happy at the same time, as in the case of the country’s decision to accept the American missile defenses.
<br><br>
Yet Ms. Park’s impeachment was also a pushback against “Cold War conservatives” like her father, who seized on Communist threats from North Korea to hide their corruption and silence political opponents, said Kim Dong-choon, a sociologist at Sungkonghoe University in Seoul.
<br><br>
Ms. Park’s father tortured and executed dissidents, framing them with spying charges. Now, his daughter faces charges that her government blacklisted thousands of unfriendly artists and writers.<br><br>

“Her removal means that the curtain is finally drawing on the authoritarian political and economic order that has dominated South Korea for decades,” said Ahn Byong-jin, rector of the Global Academy for Future Civilizations at Kyung Hee University in Seoul.
<br><br>
Analysts cautioned that political and economic change will come slowly.
<br><br>
As Mr. Moon put it recently: “We need a national cleanup. We need to liquidate the old system and build a new South Korea. Only then can we complete the revolution started by the people who rallied with candlelight.”</a>

<div class="mainth"><h1>2020 Thai protests</h1>
          <a><br>Three demands were presented to the Government of Thailand: the dissolution of parliament, ending intimidation of the people, and the drafting of a new constitution. The July protests were triggered by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and enforcement of the lockdown Emergency Decree and spread nationwide.<br></a>

          <h2><br>Thousands protest in Bangkok as Thai activists face charges of insulting king</h2>
          <d>26 Nov, 2020 <br>Rebecca Ratcliffe</d>
          <img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0fee593e67623e1bd697f0e0568e73922ef2a14/0_310_5318_3191/master/5318.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a5a841dd99140c4c6f6ee8e5f56dfce5" width=100% >
          <a><br>Thousands of people have gathered in Bangkok to demand the king relinquish control of royal funds worth tens of billions of dollars, despite the Thai authorities escalating their crackdown on protesters by reviving the kingdom’s fierce lese-majesty law.<br><br>

Police summoned 15 prominent activists to face charges under the law, which shields Thailand’s powerful and ultra-rich royal family from criticism. It has one of the strictest defamation criteria in the world, stating that anyone who “defames, insults or threatens the king, queen, heir-apparent or regent” can face up to 15 years on each charge.<br><br>


On Wednesday evening, Parit Chiwarak, also known as Penguin, who is among those facing lese-majesty charges, said protesters would not back down. “We will not lower the ceiling,” he said, referring to how protesters have broken the taboo that has long prevented open discussion of the royal family.<br><br>

Protesters have made bold calls for reforms of Thailand’s monarchy, an institution once considered beyond public criticism, arguing it should be accountable and transparent. They have also demanded wider democratic reforms, including a new constitution.<br><br>

Parit said protesters must refrain from violence: “We will not give [the authorities] an excuse to use aggression … We will not fall into their trap even though they are provoking us.” He addressed crowds wearing a duck suit – a reference to the inflatable ducks used by protesters to shield them from water cannon last week.<br><br>

While Wednesday’s protest was peaceful, later in the evening loud bangs were heard, and a volunteer protest guard was reportedly injured. At a protest last week, six people were treated for gunshot wounds.<br><br>


Thousands of protesters had gathered outside the head office of Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), Thailand’s oldest bank, in which the king owns a stake of more than 23%, to call for greater oversight of royal funds. They had originally planned to gather outside the crown property bureau, the office that manages royal assets, but said they would move to avoid confrontation with royalists who had announced a counter rally.<br><br>

After ascending the throne, King Maha Vajiralongkorn took direct control of the crown property bureau, which is worth tens of billions of dollars. Previously, the fund – including prime real estate in Bangkok, shares in SCB and stakes in the country’s largest industrial conglomerate, Siam Cement Group – was under the supervision of the finance ministry. Its exact value is not known, though some estimates suggest it is worth $40bn (£30bn).<br><br>

“At least people should have the space to investigate [how money is spent] and check the institution – not only the monarchy but also other institutions. We will not accept military power any more,” said Nik, 31, who attended Wednesday’s protest.<br><br>


Protesters have accused the king of wasting taxpayers’ money, and have criticised him for spending most of his time in Germany while Thailand faces economic devastation caused by coronavirus. They believe such assets should be returned, and that the king’s private wealth should be separated from the crown funds.<br><br>

In a statement released ahead of Wednesday’s demonstration, the protest group Free Youth said: “Transferring the crown property to the king’s property is equivalent to a robbery of the nation’s wealth.” It also criticised the police response to their protests, saying that “being near the police does not make you feel safe”.<br><br>

Images of shipping containers, stacked together by police to form barricades across the roads leading to the bureau, were shared widely on social media – prompting the Danish shipping company Maersk to dissociate itself from such measures.<br><br></a>

<a>A group of 13 international NGOs issued a joint statement condemning the Thai authorities’ use of teargas and water cannon at previous protests, while the human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, co-president of the Clooney Foundation for Justice, criticised the recent charges brought under lese majesty. “No one should be arrested or imprisoned merely for criticising public officials or a system of government,” she said. “Thailand should not respond to peaceful protests by cracking down on protesters through prosecutions that muzzle speech.”<br><br>

A police source told Reuters that 15 protest leaders had been summoned to acknowledge charges in relation to comments made about the king. At a press conference on Wednesday morning police did not confirm details.<br><br>

Though other charges have been used against demonstrators – including, in some cases, teenagers – the authorities had not previously resorted to lese-majesty.<br><br>

“This is a signal that the authorities are going to start using increasingly harsh measures to crack down – it’s hard not to read it that way,” said Tamara Loos, a professor at Cornell University in the US. However, such arrests were unlikely to silence young people, she said. “I think the genie is out of the bottle. I don’t think we will see a return to the kinds of self-censorship in public that we saw before.”<br><br>

Responding to the criticism, a government spokeswoman, Rachada Dhnadirek, said: “The government has been open-minded to rights and freedoms despite many imprudent expressions which offend the majority. The government must use its authorised powers.”<br><br></a>
